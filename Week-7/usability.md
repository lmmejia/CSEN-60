Good Design

Design Principles
- Place name and logo on every page and make the logo a link to home page
    - Navbar is a great example
- Provide search if the site has more than 100 pages (google docs/ Wiki)
- Write straightforward  and simple page titles that not clearly explain what the page is about
- Avoid cramming everything into a single infinite page with no navigational tool

Jakob's Law of the Web User Experience
- Users spend most of their time on other sites, so that's where they form their expectations for how a webpage should work
- If most big websites do something in a certain way, then follow along
    - Users will expect things to work the same on your site
    - Larger sites perform extensive UI research
- Test your design with real users as a reality check. People do things in odd and unexpected ways, so even the most carefully

Most common site structure

    - Deep/Shallow
    - Represented by folders in your project
- Home page is (/)
    - Everything else is under it
- Image on right is a visual sitemap
