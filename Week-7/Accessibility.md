    - A person using a mobile phone

- Applies to web applications
- Target sued in 2008

    - 2,000+ in 2019

## Disabilities that Impact Web Use
- Vision
    - Blindless
    - Low vision
    - Color blindness
- Hearing
    - Deafness
    - High-frequency loss
- Movement
    - Paralysis
    - Amputees
    - Chronic injuries
- Difficulty reading
    - Dyslexia
    - Lower literacy

## Assistive Technologies
- Screen readers
- Screen magnifiers
- Alternative input devices

## Screen Readers 
- Change the visual display into audio output
    - Scan a window and read things in the order they appear
    - Some take HTML structure into account
    - Useful for those with vision or literacy difficulties
- Braille Displays
    - Provide output as braille rather than audio
    - Useful if both blind and deaf
- Effects of these
    - Web page is reduced entirely to text
    - Browsing is a time-based experience
        - Navigation bar at the top will be read for every page

## Screen Magnifiers
- Simple solutions
    - Increasing font size of the browser
    - Zoom the browser
- Large scale magnificatoin (400+%)
    - Might cause loss of context
    - Might make the page difficult to use 
        - Especially if there is a lot of blank space
- Apple hover text

## Screen Reader Mode
- Simple alternatives
    - Sticky keys
    - Slow keys
- Uses
    - Some users cannot use the mouse 
    - Some cant use keyboard, but use an onscreen keyboard
    - Keyboards are difficult to use on phone/tablet
- Navigate with only the keyboard
    - Keyboard as the mouse
    - Other devices simulate keyboard input
    - Tab sequences should be logical and valid

## W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
- Perceivable
    - Provide text-alternatives for non-text content
    - Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia
    - Create content that can be presented in different ways
        - Usable by assistive technologies
- Operable
    - Make all functionality available from keyboard (mouse)
    - Give users enough time to read and use content
    - Do not use content that can cause seizures
    - Help user navigate and find content
- Understandable
    - Make text readable and understandable
    - Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
    - Help users avoid and correct mistakes
- Robust
    - Maximize compatibility with current assistive tools
    - Maximize compatibility with future assistive tools
